##### Machine Learning


##### Python - Foundations
Project - FoodHub Order Analysis using Python
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

###### Skills & Tools Covered
Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification
Univariate analysis
Bi-Variate analysis)
Python


##### Business Statistics
Project - E-news Express Project
This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

###### Skills & Tools Covered
Hypothesis Testing
a/b testing
Data Visualization
Statistical Inference


##### Supervised Learning - Foundations
Project - ReCell
Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.

Skills & Tools Covered
EDA
Linear Regression
Linear Regression assumptions
Business insights and recommendations


##### Supervised Learning - Classification
Project - INN Hotels
Analyze the data of INN Hotels to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

Skills & Tools Covered
EDA
Data Pre-processing
Logistic regression
Multicollinearity
Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve
Decision trees
Pruning



##### Ensemble Techniques
Project - EasyVisa
Analyze the data of Visa applicants, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the Visa status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.

Skills & Tools Covered
EDA
Data Preprocessing
Customer Profiling
Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest)
Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost)
Stacking Classifier
Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
Business insights


##### Model Tuning
Project - ReneWind
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.

Skills & Tools Covered
Up and downsampling
Regularization
Hyperparameter tuning

##### Unsupervised Learning
Project - Trade&Ahead
Analyze the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and sharing insights about the characteristics of each group.

Skills & Tools Covered
EDA
Kmeans Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Cluster Profiling


Natural Language Processing
Disaster Message Classifier: A multilabel classification model to predict the categories of a disaster message. Includes an ETL pipeline for data processing, a ML pipeline to train the model, and a web app, with visualizations, where the model can be used to classify messages. Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Flask, Plotly

3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets: 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

Cross language Information Retrieval: Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.

Tools: NLTK, scikit
